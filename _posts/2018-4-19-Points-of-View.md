title: Points of View 
---

Picture a pink elephant in your mind. Is she standing still as a statue? Or is she running around flapping her ears? Are you looking at her from the side or is it facing you head on? Or are you sitting on top of her while she flies around? Is it even a 'she'?

All of these are possible points of view. Although the experiment is deceptively simple, it shouts out a lot. And we haven't even started with the details. Now, one thing to understand is that the less details one is given when asked to think of, or imagine, something, the bigger is the pool of variations. That is, if I had instead asked you to picture a pink elephant lady sitting still in a corner and reading Sartre while sipping a cup of coffee, the variations would still have been numerous, but much less so.

And if we scale up to real-life examples, this gives rise to a colossal confusion of details upon imagined details that we sometimes take for a fact.
