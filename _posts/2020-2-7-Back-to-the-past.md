It's September, 2003.

My brother tries to hit me in my face. He isn't bigger than me -- not yet, anyway -- and I grab his arms and turn him around. While we are thinking of what move to make next, a small truck pulls over. Dad is in the passenger seat, smiling. "Another piece of junk furniture", I sigh silently to myself. My brother hasn't even realised what is happening, and he's still planning a devious attack on me. Dad get's out, goes to the back of the truck, and along with the driver, unties some ropes and pulls out the plastic sheet covering what seems like a small mountain. I let my brother go and run to the back of the truck. And there it sits, the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. Black, silver and shiny. I still remember the smell of the plastic. My father and the other guy move it upstairs, where rarely any of us goes.

Reboot.

This room is my home now. Whenever I am home, I go downstairs only to eat and sleep. I am best friend with him now, and so is my brother.

The PCS Oriion 845GV. The best gift anyone has ever given me.
