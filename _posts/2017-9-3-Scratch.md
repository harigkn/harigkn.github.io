title: Starting from scratch
---

We all have our goals. For most of us, the most important of them involves finding happiness for the rest of our lives. We think that if we keep doing the things we are doing, one day it'll be all bright and sunny and you'd have found eternal happiness.

Only if it were that simple. If you think a 9-to-5 job that you hate will bring you in twenty years happiness that'll never end, I'm sorry, but you're going to be very disappointed at the end. Happiness doesn't work that way. Only when we ask ourselves what makes us happy, do we understand that all the things that we're wasting our valuable time and energy for aren't that important. For instance, I'm pretty sure that an evening at the beach would bring much more happiness that a formal dinner at a luxury restaurant. It seems that we trick ourselves into doing all the things irrelevant to happiness while all the relevant ones are just sitting right in front of us.

This is where we have to start from scratch. Our minds have been wired to follow whatever it is that we have seen and heard since our childhoods. It was well and good when humans were still hunter-gatherers. But since we're not hunter-gatherers anymore, this method is not optimal at all. In an age when most of us are safely away from the danger of starvation or predators, the perspective has to change.

That is no easy thing to do. We have to deliberate every single thought, every single decision until it becomes a habit. Before you decide, "I'll just have a couple beers and watch TV tonight", you have to think of the hundred other opportunities which you have to make yourself (and others â€” that's the thing about happiness) happier.

So stop doing the things that you think will make you happy and start doing the things that will make you happy.
